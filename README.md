# lkmloader
A simple Linux LKM loader capable of in-memory loading kernel module from HTTP/HTTPS

Features:
- Loads kernel modules from local files using two methods (init_module and finit_module)
- Loads modules in memory from HTTP/HTTPS URLs
- Unloads modules by name or memory address
- Supports SSL/TLS for secure downloads

Just another attempt to use AI engines to quickly achieve an offensive goal in a Linux environment.
